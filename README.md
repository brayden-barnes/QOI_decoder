# QOI_decoder
This is a QOI decoder I made as an assignment for ECED4406 - Computer Security at Dalhousie University.

The goal of this project was to create a program that accepts a compressed QOI image and outputs the reconstructed image to your desktop using QOI_decoder/viewer. In this context, QOI stands for "Quite Okay Image", a simple image compression format. See QOI_decoder/qoi_specification.pdf for more details on the QOI format.

My code is found in QOI_decoder/src/qoi. Feel free to run tests on my code!

The majority of the other folders are test folders and for the sake of this repository acting only as an exhibit of my work, can be ignored. 

It should be noted that this version of the QOI decoder does not handle all edge cases and requires some sanitization. A sanitized version will be uploaded in the future once I find it in my abyss of a school projects folder.
